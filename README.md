For all three HMTL pages, Bootstrap frameworks were used for the navbar and footer. 

For the contact page, Bootstrap was used for the majority of the page with the form and button.

The Bootstrap grid system was used when creating the columns and rows in order to format each page. 

The buttons in the navbar are active, meaning they should redirect you to the corresponding page when clicked on.
